        "\n",
        " In the context of deep learning models, Recurrent Neural Newtorks(RNNs) were traditionally used to learn temporal dependencies. In RNNs, the hidden state from the previous time step is fed back into the network, allowing it to maintain a “memory” of past inputs. They were ideal for tasks with short sequences such as natural language processing and time-series prediction. With a Seq2Seq architecture, input sequences are fed into the Encoder, and Decoder predicts each word one after another.\n",

They operate in a recurrent manner, where the output at each step depends on the previous hidden state and the current input, leaving no scope for parallel computation.\n",

        "For a machine translation task (say English to French), input the English sentence to the encoder. Word embedding (provides meaning) along with the positional vector (adds context of the word in the sentence) are fed into Encoder attention block, which computes the attention vectors for every word, followed by a feed-forward network in parallel, and the output will be a set of encoded vectors for every word.\n",

        "The Decoder receives input of the French word(s) and attention vectors of the entire English sentence, to generate the next French word. The encoded word vectors are fed into the first decoder attention block, the masked attention block. The masked attention block computes the Attention vectors for current and prior words. Attention vectors from the Encoder and Decoder are fed into the next attention block, which generates attention mapping vectors for every English and French word. These vectors are passed into the feed-forward layer linear layer and the softmax layer to predict the next French word. We repeat this process to generate the next word until the “end of sentence” token is generated.\n",

        "Though the original transformer had both encoder and decoder blocks, subsequent architectures, specifically the GPT based models are \"decoder only\" models, where the trained model rambles on its own (which is technically called generating unconditional samples). Alternatively, we can give it a prompt to have it speak about a certain topic (a.k.a generating interactive conditional samples). In the rambling case, we can simply hand it the start token and have it start generating words (the trained model uses <|endoftext|> as its start token. For illustration purpose here, we use a decoder only model that uses masked self attention and no second multi head attention (cross attention) in the stack."

        "\n",
        "Until now we have seen what happens under a single scaled dot-product attention, the input sequence was transformed using three matrices representing the query, key, and value. These three matrices can be considered as a single attention head in the context of multi-head attention. Multi-head attention involves multiple such heads in parallel, each consisting of its own query, key, and value matrices and finally concatenating the results. It expands the model’s ability to focus on different positions and provides multiple “representation subspaces”.\n",
