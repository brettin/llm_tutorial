        "\n",
        " In the context of deep learning models, Recurrent Neural Newtorks(RNNs) were traditionally used to learn temporal dependencies. In RNNs, the hidden state from the previous time step is fed back into the network, allowing it to maintain a “memory” of past inputs. They were ideal for tasks with short sequences such as natural language processing and time-series prediction. With a Seq2Seq architecture, input sequences are fed into the Encoder, and Decoder predicts each word one after another.\n",

They operate in a recurrent manner, where the output at each step depends on the previous hidden state and the current input, leaving no scope for parallel computation.\n",
        "*   **Cannot handle large sequences** : Exploding and vanishing gradients limit the RNN modelling of long sequences. Though some of the variants of RNNs like LSTM and GRU addressed this problem successfully, they cannot engage with very large sequences.\n",

        "\n",
        "\"Attention is all you need\" was the game changing paper in 2017 that revolutionized the NLP world. Transformer relies entirely on Attention mechanisms to boost its speed by being parallelizable. As you can see, while RNNs processes each part of the sequence one by one, the transformer on the other hand processes the entire sequence at a time.\n",

        "\n",
        "For a machine translation task (say English to French), input the English sentence to the encoder. Word embedding (provides meaning) along with the positional vector (adds context of the word in the sentence) are fed into Encoder attention block, which computes the attention vectors for every word, followed by a feed-forward network in parallel, and the output will be a set of encoded vectors for every word.\n",
        "\n",
        "The Decoder receives input of the French word(s) and attention vectors of the entire English sentence, to generate the next French word. The encoded word vectors are fed into the first decoder attention block, the masked attention block. The masked attention block computes the Attention vectors for current and prior words. Attention vectors from the Encoder and Decoder are fed into the next attention block, which generates attention mapping vectors for every English and French word. These vectors are passed into the feed-forward layer linear layer and the softmax layer to predict the next French word. We repeat this process to generate the next word until the “end of sentence” token is generated.\n",
        "\n",
        "Though the original transformer had both encoder and decoder blocks, subsequent architectures, specifically the GPT based models are \"decoder only\" models, where the trained model rambles on its own (which is technically called generating unconditional samples). Alternatively, we can give it a prompt to have it speak about a certain topic (a.k.a generating interactive conditional samples). In the rambling case, we can simply hand it the start token and have it start generating words (the trained model uses <|endoftext|> as its start token. For illustration purpose here, we use a decoder only model that uses masked self attention and no second multi head attention (cross attention) in the stack."
