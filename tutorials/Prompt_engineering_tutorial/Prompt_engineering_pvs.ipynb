    "Prompt engineering is not just about crafting a request to a language model; it's about doing so in a way that the model can understand and respond to effectively. The quality of the prompt can greatly influence the quality of the output. Here, we'll look at some characteristics of good and bad prompts and see examples of each.\n",
    "Characteristics of Good Prompts: Clear and Specific: Good prompts provide clear instructions or questions that are directly related to the desired output. Contextually Rich: They provide enough context to guide the model in the direction of the expected response. Balanced Detail: They include just the right amount of detail—enough to direct the model without over-constraining its responses. Aligned With Model's Training: They are aligned with the type of content and format the model was trained on. Characteristics of Bad Prompts: Vague or Ambiguous: Bad prompts are unclear, which can lead to irrelevant or off-topic responses from the model. Lacking Context: Without context, the model may not understand the prompt's intent or may provide generic answers. Overly Detailed or Restrictive: Prompts that are too specific may limit the model's ability to generate creative or comprehensive responses. Mismatched to Model's Training: Using a style or requesting information that the model wasn't trained on can result in poor performance."

      "The economic impacts of global warming are far-reaching and can have significant consequences for businesses, industries, and economies around the world. Some of the key economic impacts of global warming include:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Increased costs for extreme weather events: As global temperatures rise, the frequency and severity of extreme weather events such as hurricanes, floods, and droughts are increasing. These events can have significant economic impacts, including damage to infrastructure, lost productivity, and increased costs for agreed-upon services.\n",
      "2. Changes in agricultural productivity: Global warming can alter the patterns of temperature and precipitation, which can have significant impacts on agricultural productivity. Warmer temperatures can lead to earlier springs, longer growing seasons, and increased yields, but they can also lead to droughts, heatwaves, and other weather events that can reduce crop yields and damage crops.\n",
      "3. Impacts on sea level rise: Sea level rise can have significant economic impacts, including damage to coastal infrastructure, flooding, and saltwater intrusion into freshwater sources. These impacts can be particularly significant for coastal communities and industries, such as tourism and fishing.\n",
      "4. Loss of biodiversity: Global warming can lead to the loss of biodiversity, which can have significant economic impacts. For example, the loss of pollinator species can impact the production of crops, and the loss of fish and other marine species can impact the fishing industry.\n",
      "5. Changes in energy demand: Global warming can alter the patterns of energy demand, particularly in industries such as agriculture and manufacturing. For example, warmer temperatures can lead to increased demand for cooling systems, while changes in precipitation patterns can lead to increased demand for irrigation.\n",
      "6. Increased costs for adaptation and mitigation: The economic impacts of global warming can also be felt in the costs of adaptation and mitigation measures. For example, businesses may need to invest in new technologies or infrastructure to adapt to changing weather patterns, while governments may need to invest in new policies and programs to mitigate the impacts of global warming.\n",
